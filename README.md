# Arduino LED Control Simulation

This is an Arduino simulation of **3 LEDs** controlled by **3 push-buttons** using digital I/O pins.
The simulation was developed during my training at **Smart Methods Company** as part of my **Electrical Engineering – Electronics & Communications** program.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal is to demonstrate basic digital input/output control using push-buttons to individually turn on/off LEDs, helping to build foundational skills in embedded systems and microcontroller programming.

## ⚙️ Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- 3x LEDs (Red, Green, Blue)
- 3x Push-buttons
- 3x Resistors (220Ω for LEDs)
- 3x Pull-down Resistors (10kΩ for buttons)
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires

## 🔌 How It Works
- Each push-button is connected to a digital input pin.
- When a button is pressed, the corresponding LED lights up.
- Code is written in Arduino IDE and uploaded to the board.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Digital I/O handling in Arduino
- Button debouncing logic
- Breadboard prototyping and basic circuit design

## 💻 Platform
This project was simulated and tested using **Tinkercad Circuits**.
